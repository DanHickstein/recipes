Method
------

Making the Roux takes about 1 hour of constant stirring, so it's best to make extra and save it in the refrigerator. The roux is equal parts flour/oil. For this recipe, you should use 1 cup of oil, 1 cup of flour.

1. To make the Roux, cook the oil and flour on medium-high heat, **stirring constantly, for one hour**, or until the Roux is the color of chocolate syrup.

2. When roux is dark enough, add in vegetables and drop temperature to medium. Stir occasionally. 

3. When veggies are saut√©ed (onions are translucent), add liquids and sausage and return to med-high heat.

4. Season chicken with salt, black, and red pepper. Salt and red pepper on both sides. Black pepper on just one.

5. When water comes to a boil, add chicken. **Simmer for 1.5 hours, or until you get hungry.**

6. While the gumbo simmers, put the sweet potatoes in the oven at 400. Get the green onions ready.

7. When sweet potatoes are soft, it's time to eat! Serve the gumbo over the sweet potatoes and top with green onions.

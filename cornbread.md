# The "Twos" Cornbread

This is a recipe that I wrote down in 2007. The goal is that the recipe is easy to remember because all of the ingredients come in a quantity of two!

Ingredients
-----------

Dry:
* 2 cups dry stuff (usually 1 C whole wheat flour, 1 C cornmeal)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 big shakes salt

Wet:
* 2 eggs
* 2 cups buttermilk, milk, or yogurt
* 2 spoons honey
* 2 giant tablespoons of butter (melted)


Method
------

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C (2x200 degrees F)

2. Put 2 lumps (heaping tablespoons) of butter in a 9" cast iron skillet or some sort of baking pan.

3. Get 2 bowls, one for the wet ingredients and one for the dry (the idea being that you'd like to get the baking powder nicely blended with the flour before it gets all wet).

4. In the first bowl, mix together: 
    * 2 cups of dry stuff, I generally use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup course cornmeal. You can play with this ratio -- if you use more flour it makes it more like a cake, more cornmeal makes it more crumbly (southern style). 
    * 2 teaspoons leavening, 1 of baking powder 1 or baking soda.  It seems to turn out fine with just baking powder as well.
    * 2 'shakes' of salt.  How much salt you use probably depends on what type of butter you use. I usually use salted butter and still put in about a teaspoon of salt.


5. In the second bowl, mix together:
    * 2 eggs
    * 2 cups buttermilk (hopefully you can find full fat buttermilk) or plain yoghurt, or some combination.
    * 2 big spoonfulls of honey, maple syrup, molassas, or sugar.
    * 2 lumps of butter (take the pan out of the oven, tilt it so that the butter gets all over it, then pour the butter in with the other wet ingredients and mix.)

6. Now add the wet ingredients to the dry, mix just enough so that they are combined, then pour into the hot pan.  
7. Put the bread in the oven until the bread starts to come away from the sides of the pan or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
